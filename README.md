*CS 111, Summer 2024
<br>Professor Shanon Reckinger*

**Collaboration Policy:** By submitting this assignment, you are acknowledging you have read the collaboration policy in the syllabus for projects. This project should be done individually. You may not receive any assistance from anyone outside of the CS 111 teaching staff.

**Due Date:** Final Submission is due Friday, August 2nd at 8 am. There are several other deadlines described below, which contribute to the final score.  Participation in class over the next two weeks also contributes to your final score.

**Late Policy:** No late projects are accepted.

## Background

You will show all you have learned in CS 111 by creating a submission for our CS 111 Final Project Hackathon.

Please see lecture (Session 17) for sample projects from past years.

Students who create projects that go above and beyond the project requirements and submit their project early will be considered for selection into the "CS 111 Showcase". Those selected into the showcase will be awarded a prize: **lowest exam score will be dropped**.

## Overview - CS 111 Turtle Graphics Hackathon

For your final CS 111 project, you are tasked with creating an open ended graphics project in Python.  

Read this project description carefully to make sure your submission satisfies the requirements for receiving credit for your work.

Most of all, enjoy!

## Hackathon Prompts

1. **Summer Olympics 2024** -- you can take the direction of informational, trivia based, or public service message.  Consider a theme around gender.  

2. **Presidential Election 2024** -  create a bipartisan application that informs and educates college aged voters (ages 18-27) on the most relevant information to their age group.

3. **Day in the Life of WICS** - create an event-driven, animated story board that tells the story of the day in the life of a famous and well-known women in computer science or technology.  Check our table tents for some well known women or pick your own.  Target population for story board: boys and girls in middle school.

## Code Requirements

First, let’s talk about the technical requirements of the project. First, to receive full credit for your project, it should at least the complexity of Project 3, 4 or 5 and twice the length of any of those three. If you turn in a project that has minimal lines of code, minimal functionality, and could be completed in a very short amount of time, you will not receive much credit for your work. This explanation alone should be sufficient to describe the requirements. However, in order to be extra clear, here is a detailed list of minimum requirements that can help guide your project, the project must include a code:

1. more complexity than Projects 4, 5, and 6 (individually, not the three together).
2. that contains two or more loops.
3. that contains two or more if statements.
4. that contains four or more functions and calls or uses their functions in a repeated way.
5. that imports data from file and uses it in the final product. You should choose or create the data.
6. that uses five or more built in Python functions (turtle functions do not count).
7. that is animated (not looking for a still graphic). The animation should including drawing and moving turtles. 
8. that contains at least two event-driven components.
9. that runs in Zybooks IDE with Turtle graphics. Code must run. If code has errors and does not run, no credit will be given.
   <br>Development must be entirely in Zybooks.  Code playback should reveal 10. entire code development progress.  Developing in an outside IDE is not permitted.  You may not use advanced concepts not covered in this class.  If you use it, you should be able to explain your code.
10. that responds to one of the three prompts and is a high quality theme.

With all the requirements above, they must contribute to the functionality of your project. If removing them would not change the final product, then they don’t count. If you are trying to minimize or “minimally satisfy” the requirements, your project is not sufficient. For example, if you ask "Do two branches of the same if statement count for requirement 3?", the answer is "No". These are a list of minimum requirements and your goal should be to turn in a final product that without a doubt meets them. Do not ask us if your project satisfies them, it is your job to convince us that it does. If you aren’t sure, then it does not meet requirement.  Most students who struggle to find enough branches, Python functions, etc. are usually "hard coding" or have poor coding style.

## Presentation/Video Requirements

You must submit a two slide presentation:
1. that describes how you satisfied the requirements, 1-10 above (this is boring, be as brief as possible).
2. that describes your theme or message or overall project purpose (this is interesting!).

Use Google slides and make sure the permissions are set so we can view it. If they are not, you will not get credit for your slides and we will not accept re-grade requests.

Your video must:
1. be less than 3 minutes.
2. a brief presentation of your slides (< 1 minute)
3. a demo of your final code (>= 2 minutes). [This means you run your code and show your graphics/application in action]
4. both partners must speak and present equally
5. both partners must be visible in the video (e.g. talking head using Zoom recording or equivalent)

**NOTE:** recording a video does not take 3 minutes, especially if this is your first time.  Leave plenty of time to do this part.  Things that happen to students while making videos: they record and it is too long so they need to re-record, they think they recorded but they didn't, they don't like the recording so they re-record, they lose the footage, the recording is not good quality, the video takes a long time to upload, etc.  This is part of the process and not "unexpected technical problems".  Technical problems are expected.  You should record your video with plenty of time to handle the many things that can and probably will go wrong.

## What to turn in:

1. All three forms in Labs 13, 14, and 15 (the same content must be shown to your assigned TA in person).
2. Fill out this form to submit your final project: https://forms.gle/DA3CVQVAoVzzQQK7A which asks you to include: (a) A link to your presentation (with correct permissions set). (b)A link to your video (with correct permissions set).
3. Click "Submit for grading" here on Zybooks which should submit your final code.  The entire development of your code should be in your Code Playback.  If you have a partner, we expect the code development to be in either partner's Code History.

## Final Project Score
- Your final project score will be calculated based on:
- Session 18 - Project Plan and Project Brainstorm
- Session 19 - Project Proposal
- Session 22 - Project 80 % Draft
- Meet the Technical Requirements described above.
- Your 2-slide presentation.
- Your 3 minute video.
- Filling out the final submission form (https://forms.gle/DA3CVQVAoVzzQQK7A).
- Your final code submitted to Zybooks and all development work shown in Code Playback.
- Your partner’s assessment of your contributions.

The rubrics are all provided in the presentation in lab during Week 13 and shown in Blackboard for Labs 13, 14, 15.
